# PokeCube: Virtual Rubik's Cube via PokeAPI

## Using PokeAPI to get data about Pokemon, custom picture cubes can be created showing off the special features of your favorite Pokemon!<br><br>
By searching for the name of a Pokemon, your cube will contain:
1. Their standard and shiny sprites
2. Their type(s)
3. Their strongest stat (hp, attack, defense, etc.)
4. Whether they are heavy or light

<br>The Rubik's cube itself is created using CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery
<br>How to use the cube:
- Click on the background and drag to rotate the cube in 3D
- Dragging stickers on the same face will turn the pieces (i.e. dragging a green corner sticker to a green edge sticker will move the pieces along that axis)
